## Comment

## Convention
**QuidPHP/Routing** is built on the following conventions:
- *Traits*: Traits filenames start with an underscore (_).
- *Coding*: No curly braces are used in a IF statement if the condition can be resolved in only one statement.
- *Type*: Files, function arguments and return types are strict typed.
- *Config*: A special $config static property exists in all classes. This property gets recursively merged with the parents' property on initialization.
- *M-VC*: A route object serves as both a View and a Controller. There should be one route class per route. 
- *Segment*: A segment within a route path represents a dynamic value. It is wrapped around brackets. A callable that accepts or rejects the value need to be provided.
- *Templating*: Once the route is triggered, the developer has complete control and can use any HTML rendering technology it desires. Or, simply use the [Quid\Base\Html](https://github.com/quidphp/base/blob/master/src/Html.php) methods to generate the HTML and use traits for reusable page components.
